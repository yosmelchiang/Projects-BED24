In number theory, an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or narcissistic number in a given number base (10 for this mission) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 == 153.
