We are going to create a program that prompts an input string.

We also want to display the output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

Example
- What is the input string?
- Input: Homer
- Output: Homer has 5 characters

Constraints
- We are going to make sure the output contains the original string.
- We are going to use a single output statement to construct the output.
- We are going to use a built-in function that determines the length of the string.

Challenges
- If the user enters nothing, we are going to kee prompting the user.
- If the user enters a number and not a string, we are going to let the user know about the mistake and let them try again.
