# Creating a tip calculator

Brainstorming
- What formula do we want to use? How are we going to calculate the tip?
- What's the tip going to be? Is it always the same or should we be able to modify it?
- What should our program display on start?
- What should our program display for its output? 
- Do we want to include the tip and the total or just the tip

Statements
- We are going to create a simple tip calculator.
- We are going to ask for a prompt for **bill amout** and **tip rate**
- We are going to do an operation to calculate the tip
- We are going to display both the **tip** and the **amount**

Sample
- What is the bill?
- 200$

- What is the tip percentage?
- 15

- Tip is: 30$
- Total: is: 230$
