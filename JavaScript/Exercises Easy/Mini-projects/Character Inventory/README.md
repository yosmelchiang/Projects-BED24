In this mini-project we are attempting to create a character inventory based on the minecraft game using the bootstrap grid layout classes

To add:
- Function that allows the user to add items to the inventory
- Function that allows the user to remove items from the inventory
- Function that allows the user access to specific properties for each item (object key-values)
