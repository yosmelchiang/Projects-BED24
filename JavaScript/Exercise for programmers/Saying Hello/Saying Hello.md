The classic "Hello, World" outputs a message but doesn't involve any input.

We are going to create a program that prompts for a name and greets the person.

Example
- Prompt: What is your name?
- Input: Brian
- Output: Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

Constraint
- Keep the input, string concatenation and output separate.
