      <h3>Solve the riddle</h3>
      <pre>In this riddle, the Farmer is tasked with transporting a fox, a goose, and some corn across a river. 
The goal is to get all three safely to the other side of the river without leaving anything in danger. 

<strong>However, there are a few important rules to follow:</strong>
The farmer can only carry one item at a time across the river.

<strong><span style="color: red">Dangerous situations:</span></strong>
If the fox is left alone with the goose without the farmer present, the fox will eat the goose.
If the goose is left alone with the corn without the farmer, the goose will eat the corn.

The riddle ends when you successfully transport all three across the river without any harm.

Good luck, and make sure no one gets eaten!
